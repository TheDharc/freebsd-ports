  KDE4_PREFIX has been changed from /usr/local/kde4 to /usr/local.
  All ports that depends on kdehier4 must be reinstalled.
  PORTREVISION for affected ports has been increased, upgrading tools
  (portmaster, pkg) should handle this update without manual intervention.

  safely remove /usr/local/kde4.

  To stay with kdepim-4.4.11.1 run the following commands:

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.8.2. Several ports were split,
  thus manual intervention into update procedure is required:

  # pkg_delete -f kde-runtime-\* ruby\*-kdebindings-korundum\* \

  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC has been updated to 4.7.2. A number of files were moved between
  packages and several ports were split, thus manual intervention into
  update procedure is required:

  # pkg_delete -f raptor-1\* kdelibs-4\* kdebase-\*4\* \
    kdeaccessibility-4\* kdeedu-4\* kdegames-4\* kdegraphics-4\* \
    kdesdk-4\* kdeutils-4\* konq-plugins-4\* ktts\* nepomukcontroller\* \
    ruby\*-kdebindings\* kdebindings-smoke\*
  # pkg_delete -f kdehier4\*
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/etc/pam.d/* \
    /usr/local/etc/pam.d/
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/etc/rc.d/* \
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/share/dbus-1/services/* \
    /usr/local/share/dbus-1/services/
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/share/dbus-1/system-services/* \
    /usr/local/share/dbus-1/system-services/
  # rmdir /usr/local/kde4/etc/pam.d /usr/local/kde4/etc/rc.d \
    /usr/local/kde4/share/dbus-1/*services
  # rm -r /var/tmp/kdecache-*
  # portmaster misc/kdehier4

  If you have - or plan to install - net/kdenetwork4, also run:

  # portmaster -o net/linphone-base ortp

  Finally:

  # portmaster -a

  Also, remove /usr/local/kde4/etc/rc.d from local_startup in rc.conf(5).
  Failure to do this will cause all enabled scripts in /usr/local/etc/rc.d
  to be started twice.

  Remember to check for missing ports, bearing in mind that x11/kdebase4*
  ports were replaced by x11/kde4-* ones, ktts was replaced by jovie, while
  konq-plugins-kde4 and nepomukcontroller were removed. Then:

  # portmaster --check-depends

  You're also encouraged to run `pkg_cutleaves` or similar to check for
  orphaned ports.

  Please, note that `pkg_add -r kde4` will not install Plasma scriptengines
  and printer utilities by default anymore, and `pkg_add -r kdegames4` will
  not install Kajongg. This was made to avoid depending by default on
  kdebindings.
